### Basic information
This projects is a genetic algorithm implementation, which task is to find the minimum of a 2d function. Later we can maybe extend it to multivariate functions.

### Tech Stach
The main tech stack is focused around Python as a programming language. This involves:
*  Python 3 - programming language

Packages:
*  DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms)
